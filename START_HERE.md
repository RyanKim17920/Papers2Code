## 🤔 Which Platform Should I Choose?

### Use Render (Recommended) ⭐
**Best for:** Most users, full-stack apps, beginners

**Why?**

- Free tier available
- $7/month for production (always-on)

**Guide:** [docs/deployment/RENDER_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md](./docs/deployment/RENDER_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)

### Use Vercel + Railway
**Best for:** Splitting frontend and backend, more control

**Why?**
- Vercel is optimized for frontend
- Railway has better always-on free credits
- Good for scaling backend independently

### Use Vercel + Fly.io
**Best for:** Global edge deployment, Docker users

**Why?**
- Fly.io runs on global edge network
- Full Docker control
- Better for multi-region deployment

**Guide:** [docs/deployment/FLY_DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/deployment/FLY_DEPLOYMENT.md)
