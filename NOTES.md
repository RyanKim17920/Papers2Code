## 2025-10-21 - Progress Tracking System Enhancement

-   **Task**: Implement three-path progress tracking system for paper implementation
-   **Observation**: The current system had a single linear path. Requirements specify three distinct paths:
    1. Official Code Posted (direct from authors)
    2. Refactoring Path (authors provide code that needs work)
    3. Community Implementation (authors refuse/don't respond)
    
-   **Approach**: 
    - Added new ProgressStatus enum values: REFACTORING_STARTED, REFACTORING_FINISHED, VALIDATION_IN_PROGRESS, OFFICIAL_CODE_POSTED, GITHUB_CREATED, CODE_STARTED
    - Updated HorizontalTimeline component to dynamically show the correct path based on current status
    - Added UI controls in ImplementationProgressDialog for progressing through each path
    - Added GitHub repo requirement validation before code/refactoring can start
    - Timeline now shows ideal future steps (community path by default)
    
-   **Testing**: 
    - All Pydantic schemas validated successfully
    - TypeScript compilation passes
    - Python formatting (black) applied
    
-   **User Feedback Request**: 
    The user asked about using GitHub as a backend for code validation (PR-based review). This is a good idea for future implementation but not included in current changes as requested.
