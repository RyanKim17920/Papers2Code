# Agent Notes

A place for the agent to keep short-term notes, observations, and approaches to problems.

## 2025-10-20 - Progress Tracking Enhancement

### Problem Statement Analysis:

Current flow is linear:
1. Not Started → Started (when someone joins)
2. Started → Waiting for Author Response (when email sent)
3. Waiting for Author Response → various outcomes

Required improvements:

**Path 1: Official Code Posted Immediately**
- If email response = official code posted, skip intermediate steps
- Go: Email Sent → Official Code Posted
- Timeline should still show these steps were beneficial

**Path 2: Code Needs Refactoring**
- Email response = code needs refactoring but published
- Side path: Email Sent → Code Needs Refactoring → Refactoring Started → Refactoring Finished → Validation (with authors)

**Path 3: No Code from Author**
- Email response = no code available
- User creates GitHub → Code Needed → follow typical path

**Requirements:**
- GitHub repo must be added before proceeding (validation)
- Need different timeline paths based on email response
- All paths should still show user contribution

### Current Code Structure:

**Backend:**
- `schemas/implementation_progress.py`: Contains ProgressStatus and UpdateEventType enums
- `services/implementation_progress_service.py`: Business logic for progress updates
- `routers/implementation_progress_router.py`: API endpoints

**Frontend:**
- `types/implementation.ts`: TypeScript types matching backend
- `HorizontalTimeline.tsx`: Visual timeline component
- `ImplementationProgressDialog.tsx`: Main progress UI

### Approach:

1. **Update enums** to support new statuses:
   - Add new ProgressStatus values for refactoring states
   - Add new UpdateEventType for validation events

2. **Update service logic** to handle branching paths:
   - Validate GitHub repo requirement before status changes
   - Implement logic for different email response paths

3. **Update frontend timeline** to show different paths:
   - Conditional rendering based on path taken
   - Visual indication of skipped vs completed steps

4. **Create validation logic** for GitHub requirement

-   **Observation**: Need to handle multiple paths based on author response
-   **Approach**: Extend existing enums and add validation logic
-   **Stuck on**: N/A
