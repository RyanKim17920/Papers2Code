## 2025-08-25 - ArXiv Migration Implementation

-   **Observation**: Papers with Code data source has been sunsetted, requiring migration to ArXiv as the primary data source for new paper discovery.
-   **Approach**: 
    - Created modular ArXiv extraction system (`arxiv_extractor.py`) that converts ArXiv API data to existing database schema
    - Implemented incremental updates using submission dates and metadata tracking
    - Focused on ML/AI-relevant ArXiv categories (cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, etc.)
    - Maintained backward compatibility with existing database structure
    - Added comprehensive cron job system for automated updates
-   **Completed**: Full migration with production-ready cron jobs, error handling, and documentation
-   **Next**: Monitor ArXiv API rate limits and paper ingestion quality in production
