1. Basic UI FIXES:
* [ ] Add border to search bar on top 
* [ ] Add animation when hiding filters --> extend the cards to fill dull width 
* [ ] Add some more spacing on top of the cards along with the Search Papers (include a Filter title there too, slightly differing color scheme around filter)
* [ ] Spacing issues are common for a lot of things such as within the papers, spacing above implementability, information above the info, community implementation progress spacing, etc.
* [ ] Make updates page collapsable or just smaller
    * [ ] Make updates pages a real thing in the backend, very basic information (do not implement right now, however edit the TODO to include ideas on how to incorporate an easy blog-like system to append new information on from the admin side)
* [ ] Increase information density of paper pages further

2. BASIC BACKEND FIXES:
* [ ] logging out (sign out) goes directly to the papers if logged out from dashboard (in either case), otherwise just go to the page
* [ ] Make the "joined" date in the user profile accurate
* [ ] Make the "last seen" date in the user profile accurate


3. FUTURE CHANGES (mixed) [DO NOT IMPLEMENT RIGHT NOW]:
 * [ ] Search works for all cases
 * [ ] Improve tagging and tags
 * [ ] Improve search in general 
 * [ ] more papers in the dashboard for implementation
