1. Urgent needs

1.1 Easier Fixes 
* [ ] non implementability needs to be removed if implementation starts
* [ ] Secondary confirmation modal if trying to say no code posted if less than 4 weeks (from ghost or they said no)


1.2 More difficult Fixes 
* [ ] Fix peer reviewing so that other users can finalize code
* [ ] Finish updates page
* [ ] Mobile compatability

1.3 Very difficult fixes:

* [ ] Combining Gmail and Github Accounts effectively (look over display name, etc. )
* [ ] Improved tagging system
* [ ] non implementable paper filtering

2. Less Urgent needs

2.1 Easier Fixes
* [ ] CLicking user profiles should go there (from lists)
* [ ] Somehow paper views works without tracking user ids... probably see how that works and fix it to use it
* [ ] In user profile, upvoted papers should already be highlighted for the thumbs up instead of being not filled
* [ ] If user has too many contributed to or upvoted have a pagination but vertical on the right side in the white space of the area.

2.2 Medium Difficulty
* [ ] Multiple data sources besides arXiv (like NeurIPS, ICML, etc.)

3. Future Goals

* [ ] Deal with the old code about isOwner, isAdmin, etc... probably flesh that out
