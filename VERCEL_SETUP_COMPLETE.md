- ✅ Each component uses the platform best suited for its technology
- ✅ Can scale frontend and backend independently

## 🧪 Testing Your Build Locally

Before deploying to Vercel, test that the frontend builds successfully:

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd papers2code-ui
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Expected output: dist/ folder with optimized files
# Should see: "✓ built in X.XXs"
```

If the build succeeds locally, it will succeed on Vercel! ✅

## 🔄 Deployment Flow

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

```
1. Push code to GitHub
   └─> Triggers Vercel deployment automatically

2. Vercel builds frontend
   └─> Runs: cd papers2code-ui && npm install && npm run build

3. Vercel deploys to CDN
   └─> Your site is live at: https://your-app.vercel.app

4. Backend auto-deploys from GitHub (Render/Railway)
   └─> Your API is live at: https://your-api.onrender.com
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Deploy frontend to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Deploy backend (Render/Railway dashboard or CLI)
# Render: dashboard.render.com → Manual Deploy
# Railway: railway up
```
